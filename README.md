Get house-price everday from 20150101 to 20170701, then get all the news during this period, try to analysis why the house-price in maanshan raised.

Maanshan is a small city in Anhui province, China.

I came to Maanshan in 2015-07,the average house-price here is 4000 yuan per sqm. It's easy for young people like me to buy a house.

But when it come to 2017, the house price raised to nearly 10000 yuan per sqm in a few months, this is a strange phenomenon. 

I want to know why and whether the house-price will fall or not since I haven't get my own house. I must decide when should I buy my house.
